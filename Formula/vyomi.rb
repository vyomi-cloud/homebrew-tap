# Homebrew formula for Vyomi — the local multi-cloud simulator appliance.
#
# Tap install (recommended):
#   brew tap vyomi-cloud/tap
#   brew install cloud-learn
#
# Direct install (no tap):
#   brew install --HEAD https://github.com/vyomi-cloud/appliance.git
#
# This formula is auto-updated by .github/workflows/release.yml on every
# v*.*.* tag — the url + sha256 are bumped to the tarball published with
# the GitHub Release, then committed to vyomi-cloud/homebrew-tap.

  # v2.0.1 — the launcher uses socat to forward 127.0.0.1:{9000,9443} →
  # VM_IP:{9000,9443} so users always hit https://localhost:9443/ (which
  # browsers universally trust, sidestepping HSTS / Secure DNS / HTTPS-
  # First Mode gotchas). Bash launcher falls back gracefully if socat is
  # missing, but it's the recommended path now.
  depends_on "socat"
  # mkcert provides the locally-trusted CA so the HTTPS cert at
  # ~/.vyomi/tls/ shows a green padlock. The launcher auto-installs it
  # via `brew install mkcert` on first run if missing — but declaring it
  # here means brew pre-fetches it during `brew install vyomi`, so the
  # first `vyomi up` is one prompt shorter.
  depends_on "mkcert"

  # Note: multipass and Docker Desktop ship as casks, not formulae, so we
  # can't `depends_on` them directly from a Formula. They're listed in
  # `caveats` instead — users install them via `brew install --cask`, OR
  # `vyomi up` itself offers to run `brew install --cask multipass`
  # for them on first launch (see maybe_install_multipass in scripts/cloud-learn).

    <<~EOS
      Vyomi ships as an appliance — it starts a single Multipass VM
      and runs the full simulator stack (FastAPI + 8 real backends) inside.

      Prerequisites:
        • Multipass         (brew install --cask multipass)
        • Docker            (auto-installed inside the VM)
        • ~32 GB free disk  (VM image + container layers)

      Get started:
        vyomi up                          # boots VM + simulator (5-10 min first run)
        # Browser opens automatically at https://localhost:9443/ (green padlock).

      Stop with:
        vyomi down

    # back-compat shim. `help` runs without Multipass / Docker present.

    # Shim should also work but prints the deprecation warning to stderr
    # (which our shell_output capture includes when 2>&1).
