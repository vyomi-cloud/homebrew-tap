      CloudLearn ships as an appliance — it starts a single Multipass VM
      and runs the full simulator stack (FastAPI + 8 real backends) inside.

      Prerequisites:
        • Multipass         (brew install --cask multipass)
        • Docker            (auto-installed inside the VM)
        • ~32 GB free disk  (VM image + container layers)

      Get started:
        cloud-learn up                # boots VM + simulator (5-10 min first run)
        open http://192.168.x.x:9000  # URL printed in the launcher banner

      Stop with:
        cloud-learn down
